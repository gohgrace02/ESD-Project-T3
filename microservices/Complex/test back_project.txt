===============================
ENDPOINTS:

1. (/create_checkout_session/<backer_id>)
- methods: post, get
- function: when users click on the Pledge button on the project page,
it creates a checkout session on Stripe and fetches the checkout url
and returns it to the Vue page for redirection
- sample input:
{
    "project_id": 1238,
    "pledge_amt": 500,
    "price_id": "price_1OzXtuBWraf69XnWOJIEupXh",
    "quantity": 1,
    "cancel_url": "http://cancel.com",
    "success_url": "http://success.com"
}
and the backer_id in the header (you can use 7 for testing)

2. (/get_payment_intent_id/<checkout_session_id>)
- methods: get
- function: after the user keys in his card details, he is redirected to
the success Vue page. clicking the button on that page calls this method
to retrieve the payment_intent_id from the successful checkout session.
the payment_intent_id is needed for payment capture in the future
- sample input:
the checkout_session_id in the header. you can use this for testing:
"cs_test_a1Uk1wvE2l0WjbZf2wNuOEbBxUzXuUUwnXEdyfXMXQiiNcirQ19cZ2GOrY"
although it may expire. to generate new checkout_session_id, just click
on the pledge button on project 1236 or project 1238

3. (/capture_all/<int:project_id>)
- methods: post, get, put
- function: this has two functions:
    1. the first is capture_payment(), which
    captures the payment of only one pledge/tracker entry.
    2. (called via POST request) the second is capture_all(), which iterates 
    through all the tracker entries related to the specified project_id, and 
    calls capture_payment() on each tracker entry
capture_all() is called upon project fulfillment/goal reached
- sample input: project_id in the header
